As I mentioned before, I used [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to create this blog. It's an awesome project, I recommend you check it out if you want to quickly create a Github Page to use as blog because I didn't find anything like it. Just fork it, change some lines in the config.yml to personalize the theme and it's ready.
Now, I'm still in the process of learning a few things about Jekyll and Github Pages (I want to change my theme so badly) but I think that I've reached a point where I have a workflow setup to work with the publication of blogposts. You know, the *non-aesthetic-and-really-important stuff*. Like words. For you. To read.

## For writing 
I adapted a few tools I've used before to this new setup because I'm experimenting with what's best. I don't think this will be permanent but in the meantime:

* I'm using Adobe's [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). This editor is somewhat lightweight and has some useful extensions for writing both code and Markdown. 
* I'm using [brackets-markdown-preview](https://bitbucket.org/begue/brackets-markdown-preview/src/master/) from Loïs Bégué. If you have ever written Markdown, you know that having a preview available before posting is invaluable.
* Using the "No distractions" option from Brackets combined with the detached preview from brackets-markdown-preview you get this really comfortable fullscreen editor, check it below:

I'll update this post in the future if I start using additional tools.
