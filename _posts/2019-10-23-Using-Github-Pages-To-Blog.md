title: Using Github Pages to Blog
published: false
---

Hi guys, I just wanted to give you a quick run of the tools I used to create this blog and what I'm using for writing and publishing. It's not set in stone yet, but this is what's been working for me in the meantime. I'm still doing research on how to improve my workflow so if you have anything better, please let me know.

## The backend
As I mentioned before, I used [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) to create this blog. It's an awesome project, I recommend you check it out if you want to quickly create a Github Page to use as a blog because I didn't find anything like it. Just fork it, change some lines in the `config.yml` to personalize the theme and it's ready. You can find the instructions in the repository, with GIFs that cannot make it any easier to follow through the install.

I'm still in the process of learning a few things about Jekyll and Github Pages, like customizing my theme to my liking, but I think that I've reached a point where I have a workflow setup to work with for publishing stuff in here. You know, the *non-aesthetic-and-really-important stuff*. Like words. For you. To read.

## For writing 
I adapted a few tools I've used before:

* I'm using Adobe's [Brackets](http://brackets.io/). This editor is somewhat lightweight and has some useful extensions for writing both code and Markdown. 
* I'm using the Brackets extension called [brackets-markdown-preview](https://bitbucket.org/begue/brackets-markdown-preview/src/master/) from Loïs Bégué. If you have ever written Markdown, you know that having a preview available of what you wrote before posting is invaluable.
* Using the "No distractions" option from Brackets combined with the detached preview from brackets-markdown-preview you get this really comfortable fullscreen editor, check it below:

## For publishing
Maybe it's obvious, maybe it's not, but I downloaded the Github Desktop app from Github and cloned my repository. I'm using Brackets to access them directly from my local folder and modifying them, then I use Github Desktop app to commit and push my changes to the repository.



And that's it. For an inexperienced guy like me, it was kind of tough just to reach this point. I did a lot of research and went with what seemed the easiest thing to do. I'm writing about in case it's useful for somebody.

I'll update this post in the future if I start using additional tools and please, don't hesite to reach me if you have any doubts or you find a mistake in my writing.
