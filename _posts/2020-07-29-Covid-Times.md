Hi guys, long time no see. There's two options right now:
* If you're reading this in 2020, you know what's going on.
* If you're from the future and didn't live through 2020, this may be news for you.

For the latter, I'll explain a little: we're going through one of the worst crisis ever in human history and it's all caused, allegedly, by a bat soup. The kind of soup you have every weekend, right? Anyways, here we're now and there's no turning back. We're all supposed to be isolated in our houses and not touching our faces. I'm still working on my regular job from home and I will be forever grateful to the company for being that supportive and taking such good care of its employees.<br>

That's pretty much how I have been living since 2020 began: alone in my house, not seeing my parents or siblings and only going out once a month exclusively to buy food. The most people I see is the team I work with and that's during our conference call twice a week and only because my boss strongly suggested we turned on our cameras to see our faces and reactions. <br>

To be honest, things aren't looking great for humanity. Unless we find a cure soon, we're basically screwed. But there are also positives to it, for example, I haven't worn jeans in a few months and I've been living in my pajamas. That's the dreams guys, and I don't think we'll ever get a chance like this in our lifetime. <br>

And since I'm not going out and not doing anything produtive inside my house, there's no excuses to keep this blog updated. So, I promise, once again. I'll try to at least post once a week. And can held me accountable of this. Like, send me a tweet if I don't do it.<br>

And let's talk! If you're lonely, if you're not lonely, if you're funny... I accept you. Sent me a tweet @scaarg.<br>

See you!
