Just recently I watched "Meet Joe Black" again. I don't know how long it's been since the last time, but I know it's been at least a few years. And woah, was it different from what I remembered.<br>

You know how they say that after you grow a certain age you start appreciating stuff you did not before? Well, it immediately rang a bell after seeing this movie again. It's not as boring, not as cheesy and I enjoyed it in a much different way than before &ndash; but still as long as I remembered. I found it quite _exquisite_, to be honest. Like it was conceived to tenderly portrait the different kinds of love that exist and how they mold us. I think I smiled througout the whole thing.<br><br>

It reminded me of the movies in the Jane Austen-ish gentry genre, with but brought to modern day &ndash; well, "modern"; this thing is 22 years old (!) &ndash; with is beautiful script, particularly the quote from Willian Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) when talking to his daughter Susan (Claire Forlani):<br>

> Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? Fall head over heels. I say find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love - well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
