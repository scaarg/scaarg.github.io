Hi guys, welcome back. I hope you're having a great week. Today I just wanted to share with you a little bit of information. More like a warning?

 You see, I've already share with you that I fell into the car detail rabbit hole [as a way to cope with COVID](https://www.acentoenlao.com/Coping-with-COVID/) and trust me that I sometimes feels like I'm putting too much thought into something not so worthy. I mean, a car is a car, right? It's meant to be used and abused, it's a tool. But I'm the guy who takes care of his things, whatever it is, so when you add that I bought my dream car &ndash; the car I saw the [prototype](https://www.auto123.com/en/news/2015-new-york-auto-show-surprise-10th-generation-honda-civic-concept/60553/?folder=concept-cars) of and instantly knew I was going to have it... You know the craziness it's going to kick in. In the scale of bad things I could do, is taking good care of my car really a bad thing?

### So, let's wash it
Following that line of thought, before I knew anything about car detailing, I used to take my car to tunnel car washes assuming it was the best way to take care of it. I didn't like washing the car myself because I was afraid to scratch it and I was also really lazy. Car washes are equipped, they're using shampoo, waxes, dressings, vacuums, so what could go wrong? 

Well, thankfully Jason from [Chicago Auto Pros](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK_FJlcU2ci-9bwq2YDSifQ) wanted to show us what they do to your car. He went as far as to buy a Tesla Model 3, polish it and leave the paint as perfect as possible and then put it through a tunnel car wash once to see what would happen. See it for yourself.

Now, he's a pro and he knows what to look for. Could he picked a bad car wash place? Probably. But I don't see any difference in the experience you get from any other car wash. Now we know what a tunner car wash does.
