My name Oscar and I'm creating a blog again.
I tried to make it using the fastest method and as easier possible. More importantly, for free.

I did it using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and it seems to be going well, so far. I'll modify what I don't like of this barebones theme to fit my taste and probably write about what i did.

So look forward to my not-so-technical-posts, some reviews of things I like, maybe some poems and rambling. Who knows?
In the meantime, nice to meet you,

Oscar
