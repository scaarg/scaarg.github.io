## Hi, my name is Oscar Garcia
Raised and adopted by Ciudad Juarez, MX, I can be a few things at the same time:

Based on my education, I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a diploma on AI <i>(gotta flex it whenever I can, right?)</i>.<br>
Based on my profession, I'm the buyer of raw materials used in healthcare devices.<br>
Based on my passions, I can go from unsuccesful self-taught musician to a I-never-really-tried-hard-enough web coder back and forth every year. I like to keep things interesting... I guess.<br>
Based on my viewing habits, I'm a closet otaku with a unhealthy liking for rom-coms, you know, for a guy.<br>

And I think that's alright, right?<br>

It's been a while since I published &mdash; and mantained! &mdash; a blog but here we are, once again. I will keep things mostly personal but please don't be offended if I publish a technical post here and there because, well, sharing is caring.<br>

I really appreciate it if you reached this point in this intro / bio thing. Now you know what you're in for. Welcome, hopefully, I'll see you around!
